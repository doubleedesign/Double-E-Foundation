## Hi there!

## What version are ya up to?

Version 5 is currently in progress, beginning with a general tidy-up (removal of things I don't use anymore, moving some things to more suitable places etc) and then moving on to testing and tweaking with Gutenberg editor compatibility.

## Foundation version?
